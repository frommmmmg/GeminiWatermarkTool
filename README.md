> ## 📌 Original Author Notice (Reverse Alpha Blending)
> I am the original author of **GeminiWatermarkTool** and the reverse **alpha-blending** restoration method used to remove the visible "Gemini" watermark while preserving image detail (Allen Kuo / allenk).
>
> This project achieves high-precision restoration by using my calibrated **48×48** and **96×96** **Reverse-Alpha Masks** to invert the blending equation. Since I published this work and these assets, many derivative tools (desktop apps, websites, browser extensions, etc.) have appeared using the same approach and/or directly reusing the masks produced by this project — because the method is deterministic and highly effective.

Gemini Watermark Tool removes Gemini visible watermarks from images using **mathematically accurate reverse alpha blending**. Available as both a **command-line tool** and a **graphical desktop application**.

- **Fast & offline**: single executable, **zero dependencies**
- **GUI + CLI**: desktop app with drag & drop, or command-line for automation
- **Smart detection**: three-stage NCC algorithm with confidence scoring — skip non-watermarked images automatically
- **Batch processing**: process entire directories with thumbnail preview and progress tracking
- **Cross-platform**: Windows / Linux / macOS / Android (CLI)

## 🖥️ GUI Application — Major Update

> **GeminiWatermarkTool now comes with a full graphical desktop application.**
> No command line needed — just open, drag & drop, and process. Supports single-image editing with real-time preview, and batch processing with smart watermark detection.

The desktop GUI provides an interactive workflow for both single-image and batch operations.

![GUI Demo](artworks/gui_demo.png)

### Single Image Editing

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual GIF -->
![GUI Single Image](artworks/gui_single.gif)

- Drag & drop or open any supported image
- Auto-detect watermark size (48×48 / 96×96) or select manually
- **Custom watermark mode**: draw a region interactively, resize with 8-point anchors, fine-tune position with WASD keys
- Real-time before/after comparison (press **V**)
- One-key processing (**X**) and revert (**Z**)
- Zoom, pan (Space/Alt + drag, mouse wheel), and fit-to-window

### Batch Processing

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual GIF -->
![GUI Batch Processing](artworks/gui_batch.gif)

- **Drag & drop** multiple files or an **entire folder** to enter batch mode
- Thumbnail atlas preview with filename labels and status overlays (OK / SKIP / FAIL)
- **Detection threshold slider** (0–100%, 5% steps, 25% recommended) — automatically skip images without watermarks
- Confirmation dialog before overwriting originals
- Non-blocking processing with progress bar and scrollable result log
- Thumbnails refresh after completion to show processed results

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| X | Process image |
| V | Compare with original |
| Z | Revert to original |
| W A S D | Move custom watermark region |
| Space / Alt | Pan (hold + drag) |
| Ctrl+W | Close / exit batch mode |

## CLI — What's New

In addition to the GUI, the command line has been significantly enhanced.

### Simple Mode — Now Supports Multiple Files

```bash
# Process multiple files at once (new!)
GeminiWatermarkTool img1.jpg img2.png img3.webp
```

Watermark detection is **enabled by default** in simple mode — images without a detectable watermark are automatically skipped to prevent accidental damage.

```bash
# Force processing without detection
GeminiWatermarkTool --force image.jpg

# Custom detection threshold (default: 25%)
GeminiWatermarkTool --threshold 0.40 image.jpg
```

### Standard Mode

```bash
# Single file with explicit output
GeminiWatermarkTool -i input.jpg -o output.jpg

# Batch directory processing
GeminiWatermarkTool -i ./watermarked_images/ -o ./clean_images/

# Recursive batch processing (processes subdirectories)
GeminiWatermarkTool -i ./watermarked_images/ -o ./clean_images/ --recursive
```

## Watermark Detection

> Inspired by [@dannycreations](https://github.com/dannycreations)'s [contribution](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool/pull/13) on watermark presence detection. We took the concept further with a production-grade three-stage algorithm deeply integrated into both CLI and GUI workflows.

Batch processing watermark-free images can cause unnecessary pixel damage. The tool now uses a **three-stage NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation)** algorithm to detect watermarks before processing, ensuring only watermarked images are modified:

1. **Spatial NCC** — correlates the image region with the known alpha map (50% weight, with circuit breaker at 0.25 to short-circuit obvious non-matches)
2. **Gradient NCC** — Sobel edge matching to detect the star-shaped structural pattern (30% weight)
3. **Statistical Variance** — texture dampening analysis to distinguish real watermarks from white/flat regions (20% weight)

A combined confidence score determines whether a watermark is present. The default threshold is **25%** — images below this score are skipped. This eliminates false positives from white backgrounds or similar-looking content that plagued simpler correlation-based approaches.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--force` | Skip detection, process all images unconditionally |
| `--threshold 0.40` | Set custom confidence threshold (0.0–1.0) |

Detection is **enabled by default** in simple/drag-and-drop mode and **disabled by default** in standard (`-i` / `-o`) mode. In the GUI, the threshold is adjustable via a slider (0–100%, 5% steps) with a recommended 25% default.

## Side by Side Comparison

![Comparison](artworks/comparison.png)
Best for: **slides, documents, UI screenshots, diagrams, logos**.

**Focus on the bottom example (text-heavy slide).**  
Generative inpainting often breaks text: warped edges, wrong spacing, invented strokes.  
GeminiWatermarkTool reverses the blending equation to recover pixels, keeping text crisp.

## ⚠️ About SynthID (Invisible Watermark)

> **Important**: This tool removes **visible watermarks only**. It does NOT remove SynthID.

### What is SynthID?

SynthID is Google DeepMind's **invisible watermarking** technology embedded in AI-generated images. Unlike visible watermarks:

- **Invisible** to human eyes
- **Integrated** during generation (not added afterward)  
- **Extremely robust** against common image manipulations

### Why Can't SynthID Be Removed?

Our extensive research revealed a fundamental truth:

> **SynthID is not a watermark added to an image — it IS the image.**

SynthID operates as a **Statistical Bias** during generation. Every pixel choice is subtly influenced by Google's private key using **Tournament Sampling**. The watermark and visual content are **inseparably bound**.

```
Visible Watermark:  Image + Overlay = Result     ✓ Removable (this tool)
SynthID:            Biased Generation = Image    ✗ Cannot separate
```

### Potential Removal Approaches

| Approach | Trade-off | Feasibility |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Extreme Quantization** (binarization) | Image becomes unusable skeleton | ✓ Works |
| **AI Repaint** (Stable Diffusion, etc.) | Style changes significantly | ✓ Works |
| **White-box Adversarial Attack** | Requires detector model | ✗ Not available |

**Conclusion**: Removing SynthID while preserving image quality is **currently not feasible**.

## CLI — Quick Start

<img src="artworks/app_ico.png" alt="App Icon" width="256" height="256">

Don't need the GUI? The CLI is designed for **maximum simplicity** — one drag, one drop, done.

### Drag & Drop (Windows) — The Easiest Way

1. Download `GeminiWatermarkTool-Windows-x64.exe`
2. Drag an image file onto the executable
3. ✅ Done! The watermark is removed in-place — no terminal, no arguments

<!-- CLI Preview -->
![Preview](artworks/preview.png)

### Command Line

```bash
# Simple mode - just provide a filename
GeminiWatermarkTool watermarked.jpg

# Specify output file (preserves original)
GeminiWatermarkTool -i watermarked.jpg -o clean.jpg

# Batch processing - entire directory
GeminiWatermarkTool -i ./input_folder/ -o ./output_folder/
```

Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.bmp`

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Simple mode overwrites the original file permanently. **Always back up important images before processing.**

## Command Line Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--input <path>` | `-i` | Input image file or directory |
| `--output <path>` | `-o` | Output image file or directory |
| `--remove` | `-r` | Remove watermark (default behavior) |
| `--recursive` | `-R` | Process subdirectories recursively (preserves directory structure) |
| `--force` | `-f` | Force processing (skip watermark detection) |
| `--threshold <val>` | `-t` | Detection confidence threshold, 0.0–1.0 (default: 0.25) |
| `--force-small` | | Force 48×48 watermark size |
| `--force-large` | | Force 96×96 watermark size |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable verbose output |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | Suppress all output except errors |
| `--banner` | `-b` | Show full ASCII banner |
| `--version` | `-V` | Show version information |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message |

## Watermark Size Detection

The tool automatically detects the appropriate watermark size based on image dimensions:

| Image Size | Watermark | Position |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| W ≤ 1024 **or** H ≤ 1024 | 48×48 | Bottom-right, 32px margin |
| W > 1024 **and** H > 1024 | 96×96 | Bottom-right, 64px margin |

Use `--force-small` or `--force-large` to override automatic detection.

## System Requirements

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| Windows | Windows 10/11 x64 |
| Linux | x64, glibc 2.35+ (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+) |
| macOS | macOS 11.0+ (Intel or Apple Silicon) |
| Android | ARM64, Android 10+ (API 29+) |

All binaries are statically linked with no external runtime dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

### "The image doesn't look different after processing"

The watermark is semi-transparent. If the original background was similar to the watermark color, the difference may be subtle. Try viewing at 100% zoom in the watermark area (bottom-right corner).

### "Wrong watermark size detected"

Use `--force-small` or `--force-large` to manually specify:

```bash
GeminiWatermarkTool -i image.jpg -o output.jpg --force-small
```

### "File access denied"

Make sure the output path is writable and the file isn't open in another program.

## Limitations

- Only removes **Gemini visible watermarks** (the semi-transparent logo in bottom-right)
- Does **NOT** remove **SynthID invisible watermarks** — [see why](report/synthid_research.md)
- Designed for Gemini's current watermark pattern (as of 2025)

## How It Works

### Gemini Watermark Analysis

Gemini applies visible watermarks using **alpha blending**:

```
watermarked = α × logo + (1 - α) × original
```

### Alpha Reconstruction

By statistically analyzing and comparing values related to Alpha, we can reconstruct an Alpha Map that is either correct or very close to it.

### Removal Algorithm (Reverse Alpha Blending)

Solving for the original pixel:

```
original = (watermarked - α × logo) / (1 - α)
         = (watermarked - alpha_map) / (1 - α)
```

This mathematical inversion produces exact restoration of the original pixels.
